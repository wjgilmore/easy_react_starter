# Easy React Starter Skeleton

This repository serves as a companion to the forthcoming book, "Easy React: Build Powerful Web Apps Using Modern JavaScript Technologies" ([http://easyreactbook.com](http://easyreactbook.com)). It contains several branches intended to help you understand and execute the examples with minimum inconvenience. While you're certainly not required to use this repository to learn from the book, I thought it would be nice to save readers some preliminary typing and instead devote the time and energy to focusing on the material.

Being a Git repository, you'll need to possess at least rudimentary Git skills to make the most of these examples. If you're not familiar with Git I suggest having a look Scott Chacon's great book (available for free online), "[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book)", in addition to Neo's fantastic online "[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)" course.

## Chapter 1: Introducing React

This chapter is accompanied by four branches. Throughout the chapter I'll give you a heads-up regarding the appropriate time to switch to the next branch. The branches currently include:

* `master`: This branch demonstrates how to create your first component
* `user_input`: This branch demonstrates how to detect and respond to user input
* `vocab_filter`: This branch demonstrates how to create a simple real-time search filter
* `json_loader`: This branch demonstrates how to load and render JSON
* `mounting_example`: This branch demonstrates various lifecycle methods (`componentDidMount`, `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, etc).

## Chapter 2: Configuring a Sane React Development Environment

* `react_browserified`: This branch provides a working example demonstrating React, Browserify, and Babelify integration.

## Chapter 3: Integrating HTML, CSS, Layouts and Routes

* `inline_styles`: This branch demonstrates how to integrate and dynamically update inline styles.

* `react_bootstrap`: This branch demonstrates how to install Bootstrap using npm, override a few default Bootstrap styles, use Gulp to compile the Bootstrap source files along with your overrides, and then apply those styles to a series of React components. Also included is a demonstration of how to integrate a Bootstrap jQuery plugin (the modal) into a React component.

* `react_router`: This branch demonstrates a very simple react-router 1.0-beta3 implementation using two simple routes and browser history using the HTML5 History API. I'll definitely enhance this branch soon to include examples involving parameters and whatnot.
