# Easy React Starter Skeleton

This repository serves as a companion to the forthcoming book, "Easy React: Build Powerful Web Apps Using Modern JavaScript Technologies" ([http://easyreactbook.com](http://easyreactbook.com)). It contains several branches intended to help you understand and execute the examples with minimum inconvenience. While you're certainly not required to use this repository to learn from the book, I thought it would be nice to save readers some preliminary typing and instead devote the time and energy to focusing on the material.

Being a Git repository, you'll need to possess at least rudimentary Git skills to make the most of these examples. If you're not familiar with Git I suggest having a look Scott Chacon's great book (available for free online), "[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book)", in addition to Neo's fantastic online "[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)" course.

Learn more about the book at [http://easyreactbook.com](http://easyreactbook.com). You can download the introduction and first chapter for free!

## Chapter 1: Introducing React

This chapter is accompanied by four branches. Throughout the chapter I'll give you a heads-up regarding the appropriate time to switch to the next branch. The branches currently include:

* `master`: This branch demonstrates how to create your first component
* `user_input`: This branch demonstrates how to detect and respond to user input
* `vocab_filter`: This branch demonstrates how to create a simple real-time search filter
* `json_loader`: This branch demonstrates how to load and render JSON
