# Easy React Starter Skeleton

This repository serves as a companion to the forthcoming book, "Easy React: Build Powerful Web Apps Using Modern JavaScript Technologies". It contains several branches intended to help you understand and execute the examples with minimum inconvenience. While you're certainly not required to use this repository to learn from the book, I thought it would be nice to save readers some preliminary typing and instead devote the time and energy to focusing on the material.

Because this is perhaps logically a Git repository, you'll need to possess at least rudimentary Git skills to make the most of these examples. If you're not familiar with Git I suggest having a look Scott Chacon's great book (available for free online), "[Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book)", in addition to Neo's fantastic online "[Git Immersion](http://gitimmersion.com/)" course.
